#Quick Reads
The Quick Reads App is designed to simplify the process of retrieving book information for users. 
It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to search for books, access their synopsis, and view relevant details such as author information, ratings, and cover images. 
The app leverages Firebase for secure user authentication and management and integrates with the Google Books API to fetch and display book data.
